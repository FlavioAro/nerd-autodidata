# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm ~~a dragon lost in human world~~ now a [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) master's student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and machine learning engineer intern at Multimedia Understanding (MMU) department of [Kuaishou](https://www.kuaishou.com/) ([Kwai](https://www.kwai.com/)). I'm also working as a research assistant at Peking University. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My research interests lie primarily in exploring the capability of machines to be continual and efficient, like meta-learning, few-shot learning and continual learning. I'm also working on multi-modal retrieval for my internship.

I'm also learning to build machine learning softwares and systems. I'm also learning TypeScript, React and Vue.
