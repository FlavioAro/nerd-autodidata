        <h3 class="heading"><b>About Me</b></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Hello there! I am Don from Singapore and I am an 18 year old student who's extremely passionate in both programming and design for both the web and iOS platform. I am currently still a student in high school but let not my age
            be the key defining factor as I often aim to punch above my weight.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I have worked with a mixture of design and frontend/backend technologies, be it for Web Development or iOS Development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-content">
        <h3 class="heading"><b>NOSSAFLEX</b></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">NOSSAFLEX is an EXIF organising tool for analog photographers like myself. It was built using Swift along with the newest framework from Apple, SwiftUI and also a NoSQL database from Google, Firebase. It is an organisation based
            and registered in Australia.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Team NOSSAFLEX consists of a small but tightly knit team. They are, Diego from the USA, Josh and his sister, Maddie from Australia and myself from Singapore. We are an international team that complements each other's strengths.
            Josh being the brains behind this operations leads our team in marketting as well as the UI/UX design of the app, Diego leads the team with his prowness in Swift as a backend language and I lead the team in the frontend department,
            helping assemble Josh's ideas into reality using SwiftUI.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We recently launched our app onto the international App Store, exclusively for iOS and we are proud to see the support the Analog community has given us. Over 1k new and unique users signed up for the app within the first weeks
            of the launch, not too shabby considering how niche our target group is.</p>

        <h3 class="heading"><b>Apple WWDC Scholar 2021</b></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">My second try at Apple's international coding competition was finally a successful one. Making use of my prowess with web development, I decided to create a Swift Playground project that taught users how to make use of HTML and CSS to create a simple website.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Making use of Apple's SwiftUI framework as well as the nifty WKWebView API, I managed to create a working editor that would allow users to meddle with HTML and CSS. I proceeded to create a playground book project around that idea and came up with a tutorial sequence for the user to follow.</p>

        <h3 class="heading"><b>Internships</b></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I have had two internship opportunities so far. The first internship was at a local SME firm that created a variety of software technologies for projects and the second internship was a local startup Fintech firm. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Throughout the internships I worked with a mixture of iOS and Web Technologies. Storyboarding and UIKit was used in my first tech internship and Vuejs with Bootstrap was used in my second internship as I was a frontend intern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inner-content">
        <h3 class="heading"><b>iOS Developer</b></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">As listed above, I have over a year of experience with SwiftUI and have had plenty of projects that features the use of SwiftUI. SwiftUI was used in most of the components building NOSSAFLEX and the components featured required custom styling to fit our themeing. I have also had the chance to participate in two WWDC Student Challenges in 2020 as well as 2021, both projects featured SwiftUI and a variety of other Swift technologies.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here are some of the projects I have contributed towards. <a style="color: #FF5733;" href="https://github.com/dhs17y2adonchia/WWDC2021">[Submission for WWDC 2021]</a> <a style="color: #FF5733;" href="https://github.com/dhs17y2adonchia/push-pop-push-views-swiftui-example">[Push and Popping Solution for SwiftUI]</a></p>

    <div class="inner-content">
        <h3 class="heading"><b>Web Developer</b></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">As a web developer, I have also had a lot of chances to practice and participate in projects to further hone my skills. I have plenty of experience with backend Python as well as databases using SQL or NoSQL solutions. But most of my time is dedicated to frontend development using Vuejs and elaborate styling of websites (such as this one üòÅ).</p>
